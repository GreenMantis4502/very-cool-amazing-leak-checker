VeryCoolAmazingLeakChecker (vCALC) is a Python-based tool that scans email addresses for exposed passwords in known data breaches. Built for cybersecurity professionals, IT teams, and privacy-conscious users, it offers a fast and simple way to check credential safety using trusted APIs.

This tool is designed to be simple and lightweight, as it is my first finished project.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

vCALC supports both single email scans and bulk scanning. You can load a .txt file of email addresses and choose to scan the entire list or just the first half. It handles up to 100 emails with smart batching to keep performance smooth and results clear. The tool includes customizable themes for a personalized interface and a built-in tutorial to help new users get started quickly.

Whether you're auditing a company network, checking your accounts, or running reconnaissance for a red team operation, vCALC is designed to save time and deliver results with minimal friction.
